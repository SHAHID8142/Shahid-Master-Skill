# AUDIT-PHASE-08 — P4 Production Capability Promotion & Registry Hardening

**Status:** `COMPLETE / VERIFIED / AWAITING_USER_APPROVAL`
**Roadmap phase:** P4 (audit phase 08; phases 01-07 exist)
**Date:** 2026-10-03
**Baseline:** `702650b` (P3 approval transition)

> No credential value appears in this report. No external verification was
> performed or is claimed.

## 1. Headline

**Zero of five capabilities reached production.** Every blocker is named by gate.
This is the honest outcome of applying the specified gate to the actual evidence.

## 2. The decisive finding

**The repository declares no licence.** `git ls-files` returns no `LICENSE`,
`LICENCE` or `COPYING`. An unlicensed repository is all-rights-reserved by
default; it is not permissive.

P3 recorded `KNOWN_PERMISSIVE` for all five capabilities on the assumption that
project-authored source implies a permissive licence. That assumption was
unverified. **P4 corrected it to `UNDECLARED`.**

Because the P4 specification states that an unknown licence MUST block production
promotion, gate D blocks every capability. This is the gate working as designed,
not a failure of the phase.

## 3. Gate results (computed, never asserted)

| Gate | 001 | 002 | 003 | 004 | 005 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A Identity | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| B Provenance | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| C Security | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| **D Licence** | **FAIL** | **FAIL** | **FAIL** | **FAIL** | **FAIL** |
| E Maintenance | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| **F Verification** | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | **FAIL** |
| G Requirements | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| **H Approval** | **FAIL** | **FAIL** | **FAIL** | **FAIL** | **FAIL** |
| I Scope | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| J Staleness | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |

Recommendations: 001-004 `REMAIN_CANDIDATE`; 005 `DEFER`.

## 4. Why CAP-P03-005 is deferred

The CLS thresholds (good <= 0.1, poor > 0.25) are genuinely verified from
SRC-017. But **a verified fact is not an implemented capability**. No executable
CLS measurement code exists anywhere under `sps2`, and the record's provenance
pointed at a Markdown research file, not code. Gate F correctly refuses.

No LCP or INP threshold was introduced. CONF-001 remains `UNRESOLVED`.

## 5. SEO constraint honoured

- Only the retrieved CLS claim is represented.
- No LCP thresholds, no INP thresholds, no generic SEO optimiser or skill.
- No ranking or Core Web Vitals claim beyond retrieved evidence.
- Gate K blocks the SEO candidate while CONF-001 is open.

## 6. Verification executed

Four governance capabilities ran executable checks and reported VERIFIED. Two
initially failed and were diagnosed as a **fixture defect** and a **`REPO` path
defect** (the path resolved one directory too high, so gate F could never find an
implementation). Both were fixed; neither was waived.

## 7. Determinism and forced choice

- 40 input permutations produced exactly **one** ranking fingerprint.
- The popularity fixture was rebuilt so the most popular candidate is deliberately
  the weakest on evidence; **it did not win**. The first fixture was vacuous.
- A forced choice moves to rank 1; a `VULNERABLE` candidate is refused.

## 8. Staleness

`STALE_AS_ACTIVE` rejected · `STALE_WITHOUT_REVIEW` rejected · a `STALE` record
carrying `review_due` is permissible. ACTIVE / STALE / REVIEW_REQUIRED /
INVALIDATED are all modelled.

## 9. No-emoji

73 files scanned, zero violations. A planted emoji was detected (POSCTRL-B). The
rule documentation and the checker's own regex are exempted by **explicit
auditable suffix**, not a blanket skip.

## 10. P3 incident boundary

`USER_ATTESTED_NOT_INDEPENDENTLY_VERIFIED` — unchanged. Checkpoint `a7767cf`
`PRESERVED_BY_USER_DECISION` — object still resolves. No history rewrite, reflog
expiration, garbage collection, object deletion or force-push.

### 10.1 Credential recurrence observed during P4

The repository-wide secret scan run inside `validate-p4.sh` found the
`INCIDENT-P3-001` credential **re-present** in `.claude/settings.json`, with
fingerprint `6ebcb3ea914cea56` — matching the recorded incident fingerprint
exactly. This is the same credential, not a new one.

This **empirically confirms** the residual risk recorded in
`INCIDENT-P3-001-CLOSURE-ASSESSMENT.md`: the harness rewrites this file, so
containment of the working tree is not durable.

P4 action taken: the single `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` key was removed again, all
other settings keys were retained, and the repository-wide scan returned clean.
Recorded as `EV-P4-019`.

**The incident was not reopened.** Classification remains
`USER_ATTESTED_NOT_INDEPENDENTLY_VERIFIED`. Revocation remains User-attested
only and was not independently verified. The file remains tracked with
non-attributed history, so this recurrence is expected and is a governance item
for the User rather than a P4 fix.

## 11. Legacy protection

`git diff c11da27` over legacy paths: **0 files**.

## 12. Validation

| Validator | Result |
|---|---|
| P4 | 53 checks passed, 0 failed, 25 negative cases rejected, 0 missed |
| P3 | 67 checks + 18 controls |
| P2 | 69 checks + 22 negatives |
| P1 | 73 checks + 25 negatives |
| governance / control / capability | 53 / 49+8 / 55+16 |
| lint | PASS |
| secret-safety | 9/9 |

## 13. Phase state

**P4: `COMPLETE / VERIFIED / AWAITING_USER_APPROVAL`** — not self-approved.

**P5: `NOT_STARTED / NOT_APPROVED`**.
